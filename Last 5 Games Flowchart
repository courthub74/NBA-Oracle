focused team score = x
opposing team score = y

### Atlanta Hawks is the focused team

      "strHomeTeam": "Brooklyn Nets",
      "strAwayTeam": "Atlanta Hawks",
      "intHomeScore": "108",
      "intRound": "0",
      "intAwayScore": "86",

focusTeam = ["teams"][0]["strAwayTeam"]
focusTeamScore = ["teams"][0]["intAwayScore"]
(link the two above and turn into a variable)

oppTeam = ["teams"][0]["strHomeTeam"]
oppTeamScore = ["teams"][0]["intHomeScore"]
(link the two above and turn into a variable)

# Compare the two variables
# Determine who won, so you can count the wins
# Determine who lost so you can count the losses

##> think about linking the focused team score with the focused team

if x > y:
    then win

if x < y:
    then lose

calculate the amount of x's(wins)
calculate the amount of y's(losses)



parse the data into: 

a = total wins
b = total losses


       a - b (last 5 Games)


determine win or loss streak:
- write a function that checks for consecutive wins and lists them
-             "                    consecutive losses and lists those

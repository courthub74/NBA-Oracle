focused team score = x
opposing team score = y

if x > y:
    then win

if x < y:
    then lose

calculate the amount of x's(wins)
calculate the amount of y's(losses)



parse the data into: 

a = total wins
b = total losses


       a - b (last 5 Games)


determine win or loss streak:
- write a function that checks for consecutive wins and lists them
-             "                    consecutive losses and lists those
